# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Implemented a brain tumor detection project by constructing a CNN model, and applying transfer learning with the VGG16 pretrained model with 88% accuracy to highlight its potential as a valuable diagnostic tool in medical imaging.

# INTRODUCTION
Brain tumor is one of the most rigorous diseases in the medical science. An effective and efficient analysis is always a key concern for the radiologist in the premature phase of tumor growth. Histological grading, based on a stereotactic biopsy test, is the gold standard and the convention for detecting the grade of a brain tumor. The biopsy procedure requires the neurosurgeon to drill a small hole into the skull from which the tissue is collected. There are many risk factors involving the biopsy test, including bleeding from the tumor and brain causing infection, seizures, severe migraine, stroke, coma and even death. But the main concern with the stereotactic biopsy is that it is not 100% accurate which may result in a serious diagnostic error followed by a wrong clinical management of the disease.
